I would like to release the code in MIT license.

However, since circomlib (circuit), circomlibjs (Posidon hash)
and the circom generated Solidity verifier (contract)
are marked as GPLv3, related files must also released as GPLv3.

The data structure itself has no license.

I release Dev.mjs (which has no dependency) in MIT license.
